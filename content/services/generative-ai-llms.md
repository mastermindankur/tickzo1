# Description  
This hands-on course explores the rapidly growing field of Generative AI using Large Language Models (LLMs). You'll learn how these models work, how to fine-tune them, and how to build powerful AI applications using tools like OpenAI, Hugging Face, and LangChain.

No prior experience with deep learning is necessary. The course walks you through the fundamentals of transformer models, prompt engineering, embeddings, and deploying generative apps using both low-code and Python-based workflows.

By the end, you'll be able to create chatbots, content generators, knowledge assistants, and more using GenAI technologies.
