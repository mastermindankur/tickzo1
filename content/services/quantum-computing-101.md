# Description  
This beginner-friendly course is designed to introduce you to the fascinating world of quantum computing — a paradigm shift in computation that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics. You’ll gain a foundational understanding of how quantum computers work, the math behind them, and their real-world applications.

The course is tailored for individuals with little or no prior knowledge in quantum mechanics or computer science. Starting from the basics, we cover essential quantum concepts like superposition, entanglement, and quantum gates, progressing towards how these principles are used in quantum algorithms and actual quantum programming using tools like IBM Qiskit.

By the end of the course, you'll be equipped with enough knowledge to start building and simulating quantum circuits and explore careers or advanced studies in quantum tech.

# Who should join this course?  
1) Curious minds who want to explore cutting-edge technology.  
2) Students from engineering, physics, or computer science backgrounds.  
3) Working professionals in IT or Finance interested in future tech.  
4) Researchers or data scientists wanting to future-proof their careers.  
5) No prior coding or physics background required – we cover the fundamentals.  
6) Anyone who has heard of quantum computing but never really understood it.

# Duration of the Course:  
This is a **2-hour live online workshop** designed to take you from the absolute basics to hands-on experience with quantum computing tools. The session will include theory, demonstrations, and practical examples, with time for Q&A at the end.
